abstract={We study the stability of steady nonlinear waves on the surface of an infinitely deep fluid [1, 2]. In section 1, the equations of hydrodynamics for an ideal fluid with a free surface are transformed to canonical variables: the shape of the surface $\eta$(r, t) and the hydrodynamic potential $\psi$(r, t) at the surface are expressed in terms of these variables. By introducing canonical variables, we can consider the problem of the stability of surface waves as part of the more general problem of nonlinear waves in media with dispersion [3,4]. The resuits of the rest of the paper are also easily applicable to the general case.},

abstract={Considered herein are a number of variants of the classical Boussinesq system and their higher-order generalizations. Such equations were first derived by Boussinesq to describe the two-way propagation of small-amplitude, long wavelength, gravity waves on the surface of water in a canal. These systems arise also when modeling the propagation of long-crested waves on large lakes or the ocean and in other contexts. Depending on the modeling of dispersion, the resulting system may or may not have a linearization about the rest state which is well posed. Even when well posed, the linearized system may exhibit a lack of conservation of energy that is at odds with its status as an approximation to the Euler equations. In the present script, we derive a four-parameter family of Boussinesq systems from the two-dimensional Euler equations for free-surface flow and formulate criteria to help decide which of these equations one might choose in a given modeling situation. The analysis of the systems according to these criteria is initiated.},

    abstract = { This paper considers surface gravity-capillary waves in an ideal fluid of finite depth and generalizes exact evolution equations for free gravity waves obtained by Dyachenko et al. to those for forced gravity-capillary waves. The model derived here describes the time evolution of the free surface and the velocity potential evaluated at the free surface under external pressure forcing. Two integro-differential equations are written explicitly in terms of these two dependent variables, and no extra step is required to close the system. These equations are solved numerically for the particular case of stationary periodic waves, and the results compared with analogous ones available in the literature. }

abstract = {We present a new spectral method to simulate numerically the waterwave problem in a channel for a fluid of finite or infinite depth. It is formulated in terms of the free surface elevation η and the velocity potential ϕ. The numerical method is based on the reduction of this problem to a lower-dimensional computation involving surface variables alone. To accomplish this, we describe the Taylor expansion of the Dirichlet Neumann operator in homogeneous powers of the surface elevation η. Each term is a concatenation of Fourier multipliers with powers of η and its derivatives and is valid uniformly in wavenumber. These are easily calculated using the fast Fourier transform. The method is illustrated by computing the long time evolution of modulated wave packets and of approximations to the Stokes steady wave train. By imposing a surface pressure we observe surface steepening in large amplitude evolution, and wake and bow wave development for flows with a close to critical Froude number. Finally, we give an example of nonlinear evolution of the distribution of energy among normal modes.}

abstract = {In 1967, Whitham proposed a simplified surface water-wave model which combined the full linear dispersion relation of the full Euler equations with a weakly linear approximation. The equation he postulated which is now called the Whitham equation has recently been extended to a system of equations allowing for bi-directional propagation of surface waves. A number of different two-way systems have been put forward, and even though they are similar from a modeling point of view, these systems have very different mathematical properties. In the current work, we review some of the existing fully dispersive systems, such as found in [1], [4], [9], [17], [22], [23]. We use state-of-the-art numerical tools to try to understand existence and stability of solutions to the initial-value problem associated to these systems. We also put forward a new system which is Hamiltonian and semi-linear. The new system is shown to perform well both with regard to approximating the full Euler system, and with regard to well posedness properties.}

abstract = { In order to improve the frequency dispersion effects of irrotational shallow water models in coastal oceanography, several full dispersion versions of classical models have been formally derived in the literature. The idea, coming from G. Whitham in [Proc. A, 299 (1967), pp.6--25] was to modify them so that their dispersion relation is the same as the water waves equations. In this paper we construct new shallow water approximations of the velocity potential, then deduce ones on the vertically averaged horizontal component of the velocity. We make use of them to derive rigorously from the water waves equations two new Hamiltonian full dispersion models. This provides for the first time nontrivial precision results characterizing the order of approximation of the full dispersion models. They are nontrivial in the sense that they are better than the ones for the corresponding classical models. }
